    "- the most common kinds of machine-learning tasks on vector data: binary classification, multiclass classification, and scalar regression (see wrapping up)\n",
    "- usually need to preprocess raw data before feeding it into a neural network\n",
    "- when data has features with different ranges, scale each feature independently as part of preprocessing\n",
    "- as training progresses, neural networks eventually begin to overfit and obtain worse results on never-before-seenn data\n",
    "- if there is few training data, use a small network with only one or two hidden layers, to avoid severe overfitting\n",
    "- if the data is divided into many categories, it may cause information bottlenecks if the intermediate layers too small\n",
    "- regression uses different loss functions and different evaluation metrics than classification\n",
    "- k-fold validation can help reliably evaluate the model when working with little data"
